\section{Conclusions}
We presented a novel method of modifying a document so as to promote it in rankings induced by a non-disclosed
ranking function for a given query. Our approach 
replaces a passage of the document with another passage --- a challenge we address as a learning-to-rank task over
passage pairs with a dual-objective: rank promotion and content-quality (coherence) maintenance.

Our approach served as a bot in content-based ranking competitions
between students. The bot produced documents that were of high
quality, and better promoted in rankings than the
students' documents. The bot's modifications did not hurt relevance in contrast to the modifications introduced by students.
